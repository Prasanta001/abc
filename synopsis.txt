Introduction

In today’s world, man struggles to make his life easier.Earlier,companies used a manual system to keep attendence records of each 
and every employee. The need for monitoring and keeping attendance records has assumed high importance to monitor the man-power 
engaged. In large organizations, where the man-power is high, people are not always in their cabins.They have to wander from one
room to another room, from one floor to another or from one section or block of the building to some other section, block or 
departments to perform their work. In such cases, it becomes extremely difficult to keep track of employees and find them when
they are needed or during office hours.Employee monitoring is the process of workplace surveillance to gather information about the 
locations and activities of staff members. Time is a constraint everywhere. Businesses and corporate life demands dedicated presence
of employees and so they incorporate a monitoring system to improve availability, productivity and protect organization resources. 
The main intention is to prevent unacceptable behaviour in the first place and, should that effort fail, to curtail the behavior 
beforeit can have a negative effect on the business.Since the information remains logged in a database, any personnel in the building
will be able to have access to these information through any computer connected to the system and come to know the location of the 
person he or she is seeking for.

Employees as well as admin can now easily view their time and attendance details such as applied, approved, pending and rejected
attendance requests for the entire year through an intuitive dashboard on their portal homepage. Furthermore, employees have the 
option of applying various attendance requests including -
    Permission
    Compensation Off
    Shift Change
    Over Time
    Attendance regularization
    On-Duty
