Introduction

In today’s world, man struggles to make his life easier.Earlier,companies used a manual system to keep attendence records of every 
employees. The need for monitoring and keep attendance records has assumed high importance to monitor the man-power. 
In large organizational buildings, where the man-power is high, people are not always in their cabins.They have to wander from room to 
room, floor to floor to perform their work. In such cases, it becomes extremely difficult to keep a track of people and find them when
they are needed.Employee monitoring is the use of various methods of workplace surveillance to gather information about the activities
and locations of staff members. Businesses monitor employees to improve productivity and protect corporate resources. The main intention
is to prevent unacceptable behavior in the first place and, should that effort fail, to curtail the behavior before it can have a 
negative effect on the business.Since all the information is logged in a database, any person in the building will be able to access
this information through any computer connected to this system and come to know the location of the person he or she is seeking for.
